## What the project does
Initially, one has to enter the directory name along with its full path. It will show all the sub-directories
and files and the space occupied by them(in bytes) in a pie-chart. Then, he/she can navigate into its parent 
or child directory as per his/her wish or can delete a file or sub-directory as per his choice. While performing
these two operations, one has to enter an index(key) of the file from the previously printed list.
