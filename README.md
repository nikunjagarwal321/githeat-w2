## What the project does
Initially, one has to enter the directory name along with its full path. It will show all the sub-directories
and files and the space occupied by them(in bytes) in a pie-chart. Then, he/she can navigate into its parent 
or child directoryas per his/her wish or can delete a file or sub-directory as per his choice. It should be 
noted that while deleting a file, one must also enter its extension alongwith the filename. If one wants to 
navigate into a child directory, he/she has to enter the directory name which can be selected from the list 
of directory names which is written in the pie-chart. It should be taken care that correct filename/sub-directory 
is entered or else "FileNotFound" error will be displayed.
